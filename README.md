# Genshin-Wish-Project
hello this is where I'm teaching myself how to
1. code
2. how to use github with CI/CD principles
3. how to DEVOPS in general

I'm doing this using Genshin Impact since a wish simulator seems easy enough.
Currently I have done the first 3 regions (Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma), and plan to add the last regions that have applicable characters.
